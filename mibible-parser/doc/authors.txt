----------------

  The original ASN.1 grammar was extracted from the yacc and lex 
  sources of Snacc, a free ASN.1 to C or C++ compiler. Parts of the 
  grammar was also adapted from a JavaCC grammar provided freely by 
  Helena Sarin. Other parts have been adapted from various IETF RFC:s.

  Parts of this work originates from an internal MIB processing and 
  code generation tool (Plug-Out) developed at Ericson Telecom. That 
  tool was developed for a Master's thesis 
  (http://www.percederberg.net/home/essays/master/master.html) in 
  1999. Ericsson has since kindly allowed the relicensing of that 
  code under the GNU GPL.

  As of Mibble version 2.0, the library has been completely 
  rewritten. None of the code from releases prior to 2.0 remain, and 
  hence the Ericsson contribution is no longer visible as copyrights 
  in the source code files.

  As of Mibble version 2.3, a MIB browser application using the 
  Westhawk SNMP stack (http://snmp.westhawk.co.uk/ 
  (http://snmp.westhawk.co.uk/)) has been included.
