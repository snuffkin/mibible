Suggested Improvements
----------------------

  This is a list of the suggested improvements as of the release of 
  version 2.8 (2007-01-10). The most up-to-date version of this list 
  is available from the project bug tracker 
  (http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=mibble).

    o Support strict SMIv1 and SMIv2 parsing
      When parsing SMIv1 files, no symbols or constructs from SMIv2 
      should be available. The opposite goes for SMIv2 files. [Bug 
      #4367]

    o Create unit tests
      All the source code should be tested automatically through 
      JUnit or a similar tool. This is a minor issue, however, as the 
      complete library is always tested with all the IETF MIB files 
      on each build. [Bug #4368]

    o Add SNMP client capabilities
      The Mibble library currently has no support for SNMP agents or 
      clients. It is possible to integrate with SNMP4J or the 
      WestHawk SNMP stack to provide this. [Bug #6317]

    o Validate SEQUENCE element types
      The types in a SEQUENCE should be validated against their 
      counterparts if also defined separately. [Bug #6547]

    o Add object serialization
      There is currently no easy way to store the state of a loaded 
      Mib, so the same files have to be parsed every time which may 
      be time consuming. By adding object serialization or similar 
      this might be faster. [Bug #6960]

    o Add error recovery for missing imports
      Currently Mibble reports errors and fails loading of MIB files 
      containing symbols that have not been properly imported. [Bug 
      #7113]

    o Support rarely used ASN.1 types and constraints
      There are several rarely used ASN.1 type and constraint 
      constructs that have not been implemented in Mibble. These 
      include SET, SET OF, ANY and the ENUMERATED types. None of 
      these are used in SNMP MIB files. [Bug #8093]
