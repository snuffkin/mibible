MIBBLE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================

Requirements
------------

  The following requirements must be met in order to use Mibble:

    o Java runtime compatible with JDK 1.4.


Installation
------------

  This software does not require any special installation. The only 
  files needed are the jar-files in the lib subdirectory.


Running
-------

  Mibble is a library, and has no main application in this release. 
  There are some test applications, however - a MIB file browser, a 
  pretty-printer and a validator. These tools can be run from the 
  launcher scripts:

  bin/MibbleBrowser.sh or bin/MibbleBrowser.bat

  bin/MibblePrinter.sh or bin/MibblePrinter.bat

  bin/MibbleValidator.sh or bin/MibbleValidator.bat

  The above scripts should find and set the Java CLASSPATH to the 
  jar-files in the lib subdirectory:

    o mibble-2.8.jar

    o mibble-mibfiles-2.8.jar

    o grammatica-bin-1.4.jar

    o snmp4_13.jar (only required by MibbleBrowser)
