    <p>Provides the primitive ASN.1 type classes. These classes 
    contain the building blocks for all the types possible to 
    represent in ASN.1, and hence in an SNMP MIB file. Some of the
    types can be constrained in various ways with the various
    {@link net.percederberg.mibble.type.Constraint Constraint} 
    classes.</p>
