MIBBLE FEATURES
===============

Existing Features
-----------------

  This is a summary of the features currently present in Mibble.

    o Full support for both SMIv1 and SMIv2
      The library contains full support for both SNMP SMI versions 
      and comes bundled with all the standard IANA and IETF MIB files.

    o Support for much of the ASN.1 syntax
      Mibble not only supports parsing SNMP MIB files, but also 
      parses generic ASN.1 files (with some exceptions). This makes 
      it possible to use the library in non-SNMP contexts as well.

    o Proper import & symbol handling
      Each referenced module is imported either from the bundled MIB 
      files or from an externally supplied source (filesystem or 
      URL). Symbols can also be prefixed with their module names to 
      avoid possible naming conflicts.

    o Full access to all type information
      All the type and value information from the files are available 
      to an application through public methods in the library. A 
      complete in-memory structure is created for quick access to all 
      this information.

    o Detailed and precise error messages
      Messages generated when an error is found always describe the 
      problem with all required details. Error messages also contains 
      a short except from the MIB file.

    o Complete source code available
      The source code for the complete library is freely available 
      under either the GNU GPL or a commercial license. This makes it 
      easy to check details in the implementation or to make small 
      adjustments.

    o Commercial license available for proprietary software
      The GNU GPL licence does not allow distribution of products 
      based on Mibble unless they are licensed under the GNU GPL 
      themselves. A commercial license containing the full source 
      code for Mibble is therefore available for sale.


Upcoming Features
-----------------

  No commitment has been made regarding which new features will be 
  present in future releases. See the TODO-list (in bugs.txt) for a 
  the currently known future improvements.
