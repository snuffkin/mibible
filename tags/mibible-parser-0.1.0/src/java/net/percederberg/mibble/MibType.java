/**
 * The base MIB type class. There are two categories of MIB types
 * extending this class, primitive ASN.1 type and SNMP macro types.
 * The primitive types are used in SNMP for transferring data on the
 * wire. The SNMP macro types are used in the MIB files for adding
 * additional information to the primitive types or values, such as
 * descriptions and similar. Most of the SNMP macro types only
 * support object identifier values, and can only be used at the top
 * level. The primitive types support whatever values are appropriate
 * for the specific type, and are normally used inside the SNMP macro
 * types in a MIB file.<p>
 *
 * The best way to extract the specific type information from a MIB
 * type is to check the type instance and then cast the MibType
 * object to the corresponding subtype. Each subtype have very
 * different properties, which is why the API in this class is rather
 * limited. The example below shows some skeleton code for extracting
 * type information.
 *
 * <pre>    if (type instanceof SnmpObjectType) {
 *        objectType = (SnmpObjectType) type;
 *        ...
 *    }</pre>
 *
 * Another way to check which type is at hand, is to query the type
 * tags with the hasTag() method. In this way it is possible to
 * distinguish between types using the same or a similar primitive
 * ASN.1 type representation (such as DisplayString and IpAddress).
 * This should normally be done in order to create a correct BER-
 * or DER-encoding of the type. The example below illustrates how
 * this could be done.
 *
 * <pre>    tag = type.getTag();
 *    if (tag.getCategory() == MibTypeTag.UNIVERSAL) {
 *        // Set BER and DER identifier bits 8 &amp; 7 to 00
 *    } else if (tag.getCategory() == MibTypeTag.APPLICATION) {
 *        // Set BER and DER identifier bits 8 &amp; 7 to 01 
 *    }
 *    ... 
 *    if (!type.isPrimitive()) {
 *        // Set BER and DER constructed bit
 *    }</pre>
