    <h1>Mibble Authors</h1>


    <h2>Authors</h2>

    <p>This software package is the result of many hours of hard work.
    The persons involved as of this release are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Per Cederberg &lt;per at percederberg dot net&gt;</strong><br/>
        Original author of Mibble.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Watsh Rajneesh &lt;rwatsh at hp dot com&gt;</strong><br/>
        MIB browser application.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

    <p>The original ASN.1 grammar was extracted from the yacc and lex
    sources of Snacc, a free ASN.1 to C or C++ compiler. Parts of the
    grammar was also adapted from a JavaCC grammar provided freely by
    Helena Sarin. Other parts have been adapted from various IETF
    RFC:s.</p>

    <p>Parts of this work originates from an internal MIB processing
    and code generation tool (Plug-Out) developed at Ericson Telecom.
    That tool was developed for a <a href="http://www.percederberg.net/home/essays/master/master.html">Master's
    thesis</a> in 1999. Ericsson has since kindly allowed the
    relicensing of that code under the GNU GPL.</p>

    <p>As of Mibble version 2.0, the library has been completely
    rewritten. None of the code from releases prior to 2.0 remain, and
    hence the Ericsson contribution is no longer visible as copyrights
    in the source code files.</p>

    <p>As of Mibble version 2.3, a MIB browser application using the
    Westhawk SNMP stack
    (<a href="http://snmp.westhawk.co.uk/">http://snmp.westhawk.co.uk/</a>)
    has been included.</p>
