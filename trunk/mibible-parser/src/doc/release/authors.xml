    <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

    <p>The original ASN.1 grammar was extracted from the yacc and lex
    sources of Snacc, a free ASN.1 to C or C++ compiler. Parts of the
    grammar was also adapted from a JavaCC grammar provided freely by
    Helena Sarin. Other parts have been adapted from various IETF
    RFC:s.</p>

    <p>Parts of this work originates from an internal MIB processing
    and code generation tool (Plug-Out) developed at Ericson Telecom.
    That tool was developed for a <ref
    url="http://www.percederberg.net/home/essays/master/master.html">Master's
    thesis</ref> in 1999. Ericsson has since kindly allowed the
    relicensing of that code under the GNU GPL.</p>

    <p>As of Mibble version 2.0, the library has been completely
    rewritten. None of the code from releases prior to 2.0 remain, and
    hence the Ericsson contribution is no longer visible as copyrights
    in the source code files.</p>

    <p>As of Mibble version 2.3, a MIB browser application using the
    Westhawk SNMP stack
    (<ref url="http://snmp.westhawk.co.uk/">http://snmp.westhawk.co.uk/</ref>)
    has been included.</p>
